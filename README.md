> ### React / Express.js / Sequelize codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo app](https://react-expressjs-realworld-app.herokuapp.com/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![](https://heroku-status-badges.herokuapp.com/react-expressjs-realworld-app)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **React / Express.js / Sequelize** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **React / Express.js / Sequelize** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
